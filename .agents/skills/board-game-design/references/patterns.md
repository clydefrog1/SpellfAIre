  #### **Name**
The One More Turn Hook
  #### **Description**
Design moments that create irresistible forward momentum
  #### **When**
Players are losing engagement or games end abruptly without satisfaction
  #### **Example**
    # THE PSYCHOLOGY OF "ONE MORE TURN"
    
    The hook works by creating incomplete gestalts - the brain wants closure.
    
    ## Techniques:
    
    1. DELAYED GRATIFICATION
       Plant seeds that pay off later
       - Wingspan: Eggs accumulate across rounds for scoring
       - Terraforming Mars: Generations build toward terraforming thresholds
       - 7 Wonders: Age III cards reward Age I/II investments
    
    2. VISIBLE PROGRESS TOWARD GOALS
       Players can see they're "almost there"
       - Ticket to Ride: Route cards create concrete goals
       - Azul: Completing a row feels like checking a box
       - Splendor: Reserved cards create anticipated purchases
    
    3. TICKING CLOCKS WITH FLEXIBILITY
       Urgency without panic
       - Spirit Island: Invader deck creates predictable but urgent pressure
       - Pandemic: Outbreak track visible but somewhat controllable
       - Root: Dominance cards create race conditions
    
    4. ESCALATING POWER
       Players become more capable as game progresses
       - Dominion: Deck becomes more efficient over time
       - Scythe: Engine turns sputtering into powerful
       - Brass: Era 2 unlocks more powerful actions
    
    ## Anti-Hook Patterns:
    - King-making situations in final round (players check out)
    - Obvious leader with no catch-up mechanism
    - Random events that invalidate player investment
    - Interminable endgame with known winner

  #### **Name**
Tension Arc Design
  #### **Description**
Structure games to build emotional investment toward climactic moments
  #### **When**
Games feel flat, lack memorable moments, or players disengage mid-game
  #### **Example**
    # TENSION ARC BLUEPRINT
    
    Great games are emotional journeys, not just mechanical exercises.
    
    ## The Standard Arc (60-90 min game):
    
    OPENING (10-15 min)
    ├── Low tension, exploration
    ├── Players discover options
    ├── Minor decisions with long-term implications
    └── "What kind of game will this be?"
    
    DEVELOPMENT (30-45 min)
    ├── Rising tension as resources tighten
    ├── Conflicts emerge between player strategies
    ├── Key decision points with visible trade-offs
    └── Engine building / position improvement
    
    CLIMAX (10-15 min)
    ├── Peak tension - major pivots possible
    ├── Big moves that define the endgame
    ├── Dramatic reveals or confrontations
    └── "This is where the game is won or lost"
    
    RESOLUTION (5-10 min)
    ├── Tension releases through scoring/victory
    ├── Players understand why they won/lost
    ├── Stories emerge for retelling
    └── "Remember when you..."
    
    ## Case Studies:
    
    SPIRIT ISLAND (Cooperative Rising Tension)
    - Early: Spirits weak, invaders overwhelming
    - Middle: Powers grow, but so does threat
    - Climax: Final blitz to clear the island or lose
    - Resolution: Collective victory/defeat discussion
    
    BLOOD RAGE (Competitive Arc with Reset)
    - Three ages = three tension arcs
    - Each age: draft → pillage → Ragnarok reset
    - Allows comeback, prevents runaway leaders
    - Final age decisions carry most weight
    
    GLOOMHAVEN (Session Arc + Campaign Arc)
    - Each scenario has its own tension curve
    - Campaign creates meta-arc across sessions
    - Personal quests create individual story arcs
    - Nested arcs keep long-term engagement

  #### **Name**
Information Asymmetry Design
  #### **Description**
Use hidden and revealed information strategically to create engagement
  #### **When**
Games feel too deterministic, luck dependent, or lack bluffing/deduction
  #### **Example**
    # INFORMATION SPECTRUM
    
    Perfect Information <---------------------> Hidden Information
    Chess                    Ticket to Ride              Poker
    Abstract strategy        Strategic hidden goals      Pure bluffing
    
    ## Types of Hidden Information:
    
    1. HIDDEN GOALS (Most Common)
       What it creates: Suspicion, misdirection, surprise endings
       Examples:
       - Ticket to Ride: Route cards hidden until scoring
       - Sheriff of Nottingham: Contraband mixed with legal goods
       - Secret Hitler: Role cards create paranoia
    
    2. HIDDEN RESOURCES
       What it creates: Bluffing, estimation, surprise moves
       Examples:
       - Chinatown: Cash hidden, bluffing in negotiation
       - Cosmic Encounter: Hidden cards enable surprise plays
       - Dune: Spice tracking becomes strategic
    
    3. HIDDEN ACTIONS
       What it creates: Simultaneous resolution, anticipation
       Examples:
       - Diplomacy: Secret orders revealed simultaneously
       - Coup: Claimed roles vs actual roles
       - Keyflower: Hidden bids create auction tension
    
    4. PROGRESSIVE REVELATION
       What it creates: Discovery, adaptation, narrative
       Examples:
       - Betrayal at House on the Hill: Rooms revealed by exploration
       - Pandemic Legacy: Sealed content creates anticipation
       - Gloomhaven: Scenarios unlock based on choices
    
    ## Calibration Questions:
    - Does hidden info create interesting decisions or just frustration?
    - Can players make reasonable predictions without perfect information?
    - Does revelation create "aha!" moments or "well, that's unfair" feelings?
    - Is the hidden info actionable when revealed?

  #### **Name**
Catch-up Mechanisms
  #### **Description**
Design systems that keep losing players engaged without invalidating leading play
  #### **When**
Playtesters disengage before game ends, or leaders are unassailable
  #### **Example**
    # CATCH-UP MECHANISM CATALOG
    
    The goal: Keep losing players invested while respecting leading players' skill.
    
    ## ELEGANT MECHANISMS:
    
    1. DIMINISHING RETURNS
       Leaders' advantages become less efficient
       - Scythe: Popularity track harder to climb at top
       - Agricola: Feeding family scales with family size
       - Splendor: First gems cheap, later expensive
    
    2. TARGETED INTERACTION
       Players naturally balance each other
       - Catan: Robber targets leader
       - Small World: Visible scores invite attacks on leader
       - Root: Factions gang up on runaway player
    
    3. HIDDEN SCORING
       Uncertain winner until the end
       - Wingspan: End-of-round goals partially hidden
       - Viticulture: Visitor cards create scoring spikes
       - Terraforming Mars: Awards/milestones shift perception
    
    4. RUBBER-BANDING
       Trailing players get slight advantages
       - Mario Kart items (tabletop equivalent)
       - Power Grid: Turn order based on plant ownership
       - Carcassonne: Farmers scoring at end catches leaders
    
    5. COMEBACK OPPORTUNITIES
       High-risk/high-reward options for trailing
       - Roll for the Galaxy: Big dice strategies can spike
       - Concordia: Rome bonus for ending game early
       - Kemet: Holding temples enables fast point swings
    
    ## MECHANISMS TO AVOID:
    
    1. KINGMAKER SITUATIONS
       Losing player determines winner between two others
       Solution: Limit negative interaction options
    
    2. RUNAWAY LEADER WITH NO COUNTER
       Early advantage compounds unchecked
       Solution: Diminishing returns or catch-up scoring
    
    3. ELIMINATION
       Players removed from game must wait
       Solution: Zombie modes or elimination only at very end

  #### **Name**
Component Multi-Use Design
  #### **Description**
Design components that serve multiple functions to reduce cost and complexity
  #### **When**
Component count is high, manufacturing cost concerns, or teaching complexity
  #### **Example**
    # MULTI-USE COMPONENT PHILOSOPHY
    
    Every component costs money to manufacture and brain-space to teach.
    Great designers make components work harder.
    
    ## MULTI-USE PATTERNS:
    
    1. CARDS AS MULTIPLE RESOURCES
       Example: Race for the Galaxy
       - Cards are goods (face down on planets)
       - Cards are payment (discarded to play cards)
       - Cards are actions (played to tableau)
       - Cards are victory points (in tableau at end)
       One card type, four uses. Manufacturing: just cards.
    
    2. PLAYER BOARDS AS TEACHING TOOLS
       Example: Wingspan
       - Board shows action costs
       - Board shows action effects
       - Board tracks resources
       - Board reminds of turn structure
       No need for reference sheets or constant rulebook checks.
    
    3. DICE AS WORKERS
       Example: Alien Frontiers
       - Dice values determine placement options
       - Dice colors indicate ownership
       - Dice quantity represents worker pool
       - Dice placement shows action selection
       Dice replace tokens, workers, and action cards.
    
    4. TOKENS AS CURRENCY AND POINTS
       Example: Splendor
       - Gems are currency during game
       - Gems represent prestige at end
       - Gem cards are permanent gems and points
       Minimal components, elegant economy.
    
    ## COST IMPLICATIONS:
    
    Component Type          Cost Per Unit (10K run)
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────
    Cards (poker size)      $0.02-0.04 each
    Custom meeples          $0.10-0.30 each
    Custom dice             $0.25-0.50 each
    Plastic miniatures      $0.50-2.00 each
    Custom boards           $2.00-5.00 each
    Cardboard tokens        $0.01-0.03 each
    
    Rule: If a component doesn't serve 2+ purposes, question its existence.

  #### **Name**
Downtime Management
  #### **Description**
Design systems that keep all players engaged throughout the game
  #### **When**
Players are on phones between turns, or turns take too long
  #### **Example**
    # THE DOWNTIME PROBLEM
    
    Downtime = Time between your meaningful decisions
    If downtime > 2 minutes, you're losing players.
    
    ## SOLUTIONS BY CATEGORY:
    
    1. SIMULTANEOUS ACTION SELECTION
       Everyone chooses at once, then reveals
       Examples:
       - 7 Wonders: Draft simultaneously, reveal, pass
       - Sushi Go: Same pattern, simpler execution
       - Race for the Galaxy: Phase selection simultaneous
    
    2. MEANINGFUL OBSERVATION
       What others do affects your decisions
       Examples:
       - Catan: Trades can happen any time
       - Azul: Watching opponent picks informs your strategy
       - Ticket to Ride: Track what routes others are building
    
    3. SHORT TURNS WITH SIMPLE DECISIONS
       Many small decisions vs few big ones
       Examples:
       - Splendor: Take gems OR buy card OR reserve. Done.
       - Kingdomino: Pick tile, place tile. 30 seconds.
       - The Crew: Play one card. Next player.
    
    4. PARALLEL PROCESSING
       Multiple things happen at once
       Examples:
       - Cosmic Encounter: Defense happens during attack
       - Spirit Island: All spirits plan simultaneously
       - Captain Sonar: Real-time parallel processing
    
    5. BETWEEN-TURN PLANNING
       Give players homework during others' turns
       Examples:
       - Terraforming Mars: Plan card purchases during others
       - Wingspan: Evaluate food conversion while waiting
       - Agricola: Which action to take when available?
    
    ## DOWNTIME AUDIT:
    
    For each player count, time:
    - Average turn length
    - Time between your turns
    - Engagement during others' turns (scale 1-5)
    
    Target: <90 seconds between meaningful decisions
    If >3 minutes, redesign is needed
    

## Anti-Patterns


---
  #### **Name**
Kitchen Sink Design
  #### **Description**
Adding mechanisms until the game does "everything"
  #### **Why**
    Complexity compounds. Each new mechanism interacts with all existing mechanisms.
    5 mechanisms = 10 interactions to balance. 10 mechanisms = 45 interactions.
    Teaching time explodes. Edge cases multiply. Playtesters can't evaluate because
    they're too busy remembering rules. The game becomes impressive but not fun.
    
  #### **Instead**
    Identify your core loop. What is THE experience you're creating?
    Every mechanism must serve that experience. If it doesn't, cut it.
    
    The Lacerda Test: Can you explain your game in under 2 minutes?
    If not, you have too much. Even Lacerda games can be explained in 2 minutes.
    
    Exercise: Remove your favorite mechanism. If the game still works,
    you probably didn't need it.

  #### **Name**
Rules Lawyer Bait
  #### **Description**
Ambiguous rules that require interpretation or edge case rulings
  #### **Why**
    Players stop having fun and start debating. FAQ sections grow endlessly.
    BGG forums fill with "how does X work with Y?" posts. Playtesters miss
    problems because they house-ruled past them. Tournament play becomes
    inconsistent. Trust in your design erodes.
    
  #### **Instead**
    Strict formal language. "May" vs "must" vs "should" must be intentional.
    Test every edge case. Run "adversarial playtests" where players try to break rules.
    
    Rulebook structure:
    1. Game overview (the story)
    2. Components list
    3. Setup
    4. Turn structure
    5. End game and scoring
    6. Detailed rules alphabetically
    7. FAQ section
    
    Have a non-gamer read the rulebook. Where do they stop and ask questions?
    

---
  #### **Name**
Analysis Paralysis Traps
  #### **Description**
Decision points with too many equally-valid options
  #### **Why**
    Players freeze. Game time doubles or triples. Experienced players dominate
    through speed rather than strategy. New players feel overwhelmed and don't
    return. The 90-minute game becomes 3 hours.
    
  #### **Instead**
    Constrain choices. 3-5 meaningful options is ideal.
    
    Techniques:
    - Hidden information limits calculation
    - Time pressure (sand timers, real-time elements)
    - Meaningful but not crippling decisions
    - Recoverable mistakes (not "one wrong move = lose")
    - Cascading decisions (choice A limits choice B options)
    
    Exception: Strategic games marketed to heavy gamers can have more options,
    but even Food Chain Magnate limits choices through employee availability.

  #### **Name**
Runaway Leader Syndrome
  #### **Description**
Early advantages compound until the game is decided well before it ends
  #### **Why**
    Players recognize they've lost and disengage. "Dead player walking" for 45+
    minutes is miserable. The player in the lead is bored because there's no
    challenge. Nobody wants to replay. Word of mouth: "whoever gets lucky early wins."
    
  #### **Instead**
    Implement catch-up mechanisms (see Catch-up Mechanisms pattern).
    Test with intentional handicaps. Start one player ahead in playtests.
    Can trailing players mount credible comeback?
    
    Diminishing returns on dominant strategies.
    Kingmaker avoidance (don't let losing players determine winner).
    Hidden scoring to obscure true leader.
    

---
  #### **Name**
Theme Pasted On
  #### **Description**
Mechanics that don't connect to theme - theme is just artwork
  #### **Why**
    Players don't remember the game. No stories emerge from play. Mechanics feel
    arbitrary instead of intuitive. Teaching is harder because rules don't "make sense."
    The game is forgettable in a sea of 3,000+ releases per year.
    
  #### **Instead**
    Theme informs mechanics. Cole Wehrle approach: mechanics ARE the argument.
    
    Test: Can you explain WHY a rule exists in terms of the theme?
    "You can only attack adjacent territories because armies need supply lines."
    vs
    "You can only attack adjacent territories because that's the rule."
    
    Root example: Cats spread across the board because they're industrializing.
    Woodland Alliance grows from sympathy because revolution builds from grievance.
    The faction abilities ARE the story.
    

---
  #### **Name**
First Player Advantage Lock
  #### **Description**
Going first provides significant advantage with no balancing mechanism
  #### **Why**
    Experienced players always want first player. New players are at disadvantage
    through no fault of their own. Randomness of seating determines outcome.
    Competitive play becomes unfair. Players feel cheated by turn order.
    
  #### **Instead**
    Test first player advantage explicitly. Run games where same player always goes first.
    If they win significantly more, you have a problem.
    
    Solutions:
    - Variable turn order (Power Grid, Carcassonne farmers)
    - Compensating resources (extra money, cards)
    - Draft first player position (bid resources for it)
    - Rotating first player by round
    - Simultaneous action selection eliminates the issue
